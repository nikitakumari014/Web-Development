      Frames divide a browser window into two or more separate pieces or panes,
      with each pane containing a separate web page. One of the key advantages
      that frames offer is that we can load and reload single panes without
      having to reload the entire contents of the browser window. A collection
      of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset . A frameset
      divides the window into rows and columns (rather like a table). The
      simplest of framesets might just divide the screen into two rows, whereas
      a complex frameset could use several rows and columns.

      There is also a special kind of frame called an iframe which is a single
      window that can sit anywhere inside a page.

      If a user â€™ s browser does not support frames, the contents of the
      noframes element should be displayed to the user.A body element should be
      placed inside the noframes element because if a browser does not
      understand the frameset element, it should ignore the frameset element and
      the noframes element, then display what is inside the body element
      contained in the noframes element.
